I want to specialise in working with robots and sensors and visualising these and using AI to predict future data. For this reason, I am currently working on a project at Kensan where I am involved in automating a small-scale factory and providing a visualisation for it.",

I enjoy experiencing new cultures and immersing myself in them by learning new languages and seeing places I would normally never get to see through games like Geoguessr."

        "projects_pizero2wwebpage": "This is the webpage for my pi zero 2 w, on this page I can control the lights remotely and see the potentiometer live. Each of the flashes will be shown shown live in the square below the button with almost no delay. Also there is an RGB light where you can drag 3 sliders for each of the RGB values, which you can also see changing live. Lastly there is a a potentionmeter when which you turn it up more, the slider goes up further up. This webpage was made with typescript, nextjs for the frontend and an express server in the backend. Also I used material ui for some of the frontend elements. This webpage is on docker and was put on a domain which was remotely accessible and I let some people test it out, which was really fun.",
        "projects_pizero2wremote": "The code written in python with which I control the Raspberry pi zero 2 w remotely. In here I worked with Flask to create a web api which i could control the flashes with of the red, green and blue lights and I used websockets to give live feedback to the website for the flashes. I also used Micropython to read out a potentiometer with a pi pico and send the data to the pi zero 2 w via UART, which was really fun and challenging.",
        "projects_jukebox": "A web application where you can create playlists from a selection of music, it displays the genres and each song under it. You can add the songs to a playlist and save the playlist to your account if you are logged in. Each of the playlists are editable and deletable. This application was made in Typescript and uses nextjs for the frontend, an express server for the backend with prisma as orm and a postgresql database.",
        "projects_gameplanner": "A basic php app where you can plan a game with your friends. There is a list of games to select from and you can choose your date and time to play this game. Also you can select who explains the game and who is participating. When you submit the form it gets put on a list of games and you can edit or delete each of those. This was made in PHP with a MySQL database.",
        "projects_pokemon": "A very simple console based Pokemon Battle Simulator, where you don't have much interaction and the battles are fully automatic. You choose a name for 2 different trainers and each of these trainers gets a set of Pokeballs in their Pokebelt. The battle goes in rounds and each of the trainers throws one of their Pokeballs at random and the Pokemon with a strength wins the round. The trainer with the most wins after both the belts are empty wins and the game shows the score and asks if you want to play another battle. This is my first experience with OOP programming and also the first time in C# so it's very simple."
