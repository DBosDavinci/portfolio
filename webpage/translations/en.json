I want to specialise in working with robots and sensors and visualising these and using AI to predict future data. For this reason, I am currently working on a project at Kensan where I am involved in automating a small-scale factory and providing a visualisation for it.",

I enjoy experiencing new cultures and immersing myself in them by learning new languages and seeing places I would normally never get to see through games like Geoguessr."
